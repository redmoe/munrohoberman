        <h2>Submarine Game</h2>
        <p>Join me on a journey through my back catalogue of submarine games from novice pixel art to Russian Avant garde vector art and a couple of little prototypes!</p>

        <i>Taking a nap under the great wide ocean.</i>
        <p>Our first stop is the version I built in Construct 2 wayyy back in 2016. It has confusing controls and is nowhere near finished, but there are a lot of neat features like being able to put torpedos back, go prone and break dance, even sleep in a bed! The reason I keep redrawing this game might be because it was the first "game" where I felt like I was really making a game.</p>

        <i>This is an ideal tutorial. I mean I even use the word "basics"!</i>

        <i>Who doesn't need a matching shark to go with the kitchen set?</i>
        <p>I got into this program called Hexels, and thus began to recreate the game in this new fangled thing called "isometric" perspective.</p>

        <i>Cross sections are way too much fun to make!</i>

        <i>Cross section + gif = awesome</i>
        <img src="images/submarine5.png">
        <p>I went to see a show of Russian Avant garde art and the palettes really spoke to me so I took another crack at the game art. Also tried a new effect for Hexels called Normal Map Shading.</p>
        <img src="images/submarine6.png">
        <p>Drew some characters during this time for the game.</p> 
        <img src="images/submarine9.PNG">              
        <p>If you got this far you deserve a secret. I tried to recreate the game in Pico-8 for a week. It's only got the walking, ladder climbing, and door slamming but it's fun little diversion.</p>

        <img src="images/submarine7.png">        
        <p>I tried taking some newer art and making a game into it. Another prototype test, trying to figure out how sinking would work and proper submarine movement. Totally not a full game. If that interests you, link:</p>
